# Setting up your server

This guide will go over some of the key elements of the <LinkButton text={"server.cfg"} image={"https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server-vanilla/#servercfg"}/>.

## Server Banner

In your server cfg you can define your connection banner, any image size will work but if you're looking to taylor your banner to have the best ratio we suggest using <code>1865 x 108</code>.
```bash
sets banner_detail "https://url.to/image.png"
sets banner_connecting "https://url.to/image.png"
```

## Locale identifier

Each server is localized in a country/region, this is done with the following convar:
```bash
sets locale "root-AQ"
```
Here a couple of common locales:
 
| Region        | Region Code      |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| America       |<code>en-US</code>|
| Canada        |<code>fr-CA</code>|
| France        |<code>fr-FR</code>|
| Netherlands   |<code>nl-NL</code>|
| Brasil        |<code>pt-BR</code>|
| Britain       |<code>en-GB</code>|

<Callout type="info">
You can find more locale codes <LinkButton text={"here"} image={"https://simplelocalize.io/data/locales/"}/>
*Please note that some might not work*

## Resource Start Handling

Your <code>server.cfg</code> will have an entire section which will define the start order for all your resources.
Please note that there are certain particularities with this that need to be taken into account.

### Start or Ensure ?

Using ensure will restart or start a resource, don't use it in the server.cfg instead use start it'll avoid restarting dependancies which will break scripts.

### Resource Organization
You can group multiple resources in one "sub-folder" inside your <code>resources/</code> folder.
To do so create a new folder and place square brackets around the name as such: `[foo-bar]`, now all resources listed in this section will be usable.

Here's a file tree that will work:
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="spawnmanager" />
    <FileTree.File name="baseevents" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="[test]" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="example-loadscreen" />
      <FileTree.File name="fivem" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

You can start `example-loadscreen` and `fivem` together by adding `start [test]` in your server cfg.
